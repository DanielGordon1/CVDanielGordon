        Hey there,
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a sociologist, cultural omnivore and outdoor sports lover with 4 years of experience developing applications. Ive worked as a (freelance) full-stack developer and programming teacher in the past few years. Creating and sharing memorable experiences in tech and life is what drives me.

        <br>
        After graduating in Sociology on a thesis regarding young entrepreneurs in Shenzhen <em>(considered the Silicon Valley of hardware)</em> my interest in the the tech- and startup scene was sparked. Upon following a traineeship towards social entrepreneurship and starting my own social startup I decided I wanted to learn how to code. <a href="http://www.lewagon.org/en">Le Wagon</a> Dev bootcamp gave me the tools to work in a tech-company as a developer or to take my own startup to the next level.

        <br>
        I love outdoor sports like surfing and skateboarding, but somehow spend most of my time behind a computer.
